Q: What is a black hole?
A: A region of spacetime where gravity is so strong that nothing, not even light, can escape.

Q: What is the event horizon?
A: The boundary around a black hole beyond which escape is impossible. It's often called the "point of no return."

Q: What is a singularity?
A: The theoretical one-dimensional point at the center of a black hole where mass is infinitely dense and the laws of physics as we know them break down.

Q: Who first predicted the existence of black holes?
A: The concept arises from Albert Einstein's theory of general relativity, with Karl Schwarzschild providing the first exact solution in 1915 that characterized a black hole.

Q: What is the escape velocity of a black hole?
A: At the event horizon, the escape velocity is equal to the speed of light. Inside the event horizon, it is greater than the speed of light.

Q: What are the three fundamental properties that describe a black hole?
A: Mass, spin (angular momentum), and electric charge. This is known as the "no-hair theorem."

Q: What is a Schwarzschild black hole?
A: A non-rotating, uncharged black hole, the simplest type, defined only by its mass.

Q: What is a Kerr black hole?
A: A rotating black hole, which is more common in the universe as the stars they form from are typically rotating.

Q: What is the Schwarzschild radius?
A: The radius of the event horizon for a non-rotating (Schwarzschild) black hole. It is directly proportional to the black hole's mass.

Q: If the Sun were to become a black hole, would its gravity pull Earth in?
A: No. If the Sun collapsed into a black hole of the same mass, Earth would continue to orbit it just as it does now, as the gravitational pull at our distance would not change.

Q: Does a black hole have a surface?
A: No, a black hole does not have a solid surface. The event horizon is a boundary in spacetime, not a physical surface.

Q: Can we see a black hole?
A: No, we cannot see a black hole directly because it emits no light. We detect it by observing its effects on nearby matter and spacetime.

Q: What is the ergosphere?
A: A region outside the event horizon of a rotating (Kerr) black hole where spacetime itself is dragged around. Objects can escape the ergosphere, but cannot remain stationary.

Q: What is the photon sphere?
A: An area or region of space where gravity is so strong that photons are forced to travel in orbits. It exists just outside the event horizon.

Q: What is the "no-hair theorem"?
A: A theorem stating that a stable black hole is completely characterized by only three external properties: its mass, electric charge, and angular momentum. All other information ("hair") is lost.

Q: What is a Reissner-Nordström black hole?
A: A black hole that has electric charge but does not rotate.

Q: How does a black hole's gravity affect time?
A: Due to gravitational time dilation, time passes more slowly for an observer closer to a black hole's strong gravitational field compared to an observer farther away.

Q: What would happen to time at the event horizon?
A: To a distant observer, an object falling into a black hole would appear to slow down and freeze at the event horizon, its light becoming infinitely redshifted.

Q: What is gravitational redshift?
A: The phenomenon where light escaping from a strong gravitational field loses energy and its wavelength becomes longer (shifted towards the red end of the spectrum).

Q: What is spacetime?
A: The four-dimensional fabric that combines the three dimensions of space with the one dimension of time, as described by Einstein's theory of relativity.

Q: How do black holes affect spacetime?
A: A black hole's immense mass creates a deep "well" or curvature in spacetime.

Q: Is a black hole a hole in space?
A: It's not a hole in the conventional sense, but rather a huge amount of matter packed into an extremely small volume, creating an intense gravitational field.

Q: What is the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO)?
A: The smallest orbit a particle can maintain around a black hole without inevitably falling in. Inside the ISCO, no stable orbits are possible.

Q: Could a black hole have a negative mass?
A: In classical general relativity, black holes are assumed to have positive mass. Theoretical concepts like wormholes might involve negative mass, but this is highly speculative.

Q: What are primordial black holes?
A: Hypothetical black holes that may have formed in the very early universe from the collapse of dense regions of matter, not from stars.

Q: How do supermassive black holes grow so large?
A: They are thought to grow by accreting vast amounts of gas and dust from their host galaxy and by merging with other stars and black holes.

Q: What is the mass of a typical stellar-mass black hole?
A: They generally have masses ranging from about 3 to a few dozen times the mass of the Sun.

Q: Can a star like our Sun become a black hole?
A: No, the Sun is not massive enough. It will end its life as a white dwarf.

Q: What is a hypernova?
A: An extremely powerful type of supernova, also called a collapsar, that is thought to be the origin of some stellar-mass black holes and long-duration gamma-ray bursts.

Q: Do all massive stars become black holes?
A: No. Massive stars that are not massive enough to form a black hole will collapse into an ultra-dense object called a neutron star.

Q: What is the Chandrasekhar limit?

Q: What is a quasar?
A: An extremely luminous active galactic nucleus (AGN), in which a supermassive black hole is accreting matter at a very high rate, causing its accretion disk to shine intensely.

Q: Are quasars a type of black hole?
A: No, a quasar is the phenomenon of intense light and energy produced by matter falling into a supermassive black hole, not the black hole itself.

Q: How does a black hole merger occur?
A: Two black holes in a binary system will gradually spiral inward as they lose orbital energy by emitting gravitational waves, eventually colliding and merging into a single, larger black hole.

Q: What happens to the event horizon during a black hole merger?
A: The event horizons of the two black holes combine to form a single, larger event horizon for the new black hole. The area of the final event horizon must be greater than or equal to the sum of the areas of the original two.

Q: How common are stellar-mass black holes?
A: Astronomers estimate there could be as many as 100 million stellar-mass black holes in the Milky Way galaxy alone.

Q: Could primordial black holes be a component of dark matter?
A: It's a possibility that is being investigated. If they exist, they would be very difficult to detect but could account for some or all of the universe's dark matter.

Q: What is direct collapse?
A: A theoretical model for the formation of supermassive black holes where a massive cloud of primordial gas collapses directly into a black hole without first forming a star.

Q: Can a black hole "die" or disappear?
A: According to Stephen Hawking's theory, black holes can slowly evaporate over immense timescales by emitting Hawking radiation.

Q: How does a black hole's spin affect its formation?
A: The angular momentum of the collapsing star is conserved, resulting in the newly formed black hole being a rotating (Kerr) black hole.

Q: What is an accretion disk?
A: A disk of gas, dust, and other matter that orbits a black hole (or other massive object). Friction within the disk heats the material, causing it to glow brightly.

Q: Why do accretion disks get so hot?
A: Extreme friction and tidal forces heat the material in the disk to millions of degrees as it spirals closer to the black hole's event horizon.

Q: What is spaghettification?
A: The process by which an object would be stretched and torn apart by extreme tidal forces when it gets too close to a black hole.

Q: Why does spaghettification occur?
A: It occurs because the gravitational pull on the part of the object closer to the black hole is significantly stronger than the pull on the part farther away.

Q: What is a tidal disruption event (TDE)?
A: An event that occurs when a star passes close enough to a supermassive black hole to be torn apart by its tidal forces, a stellar-scale spaghettification.

Q: What is gravitational lensing?
A: The bending of light from a distant source as it passes by a massive object, such as a black hole or galaxy, which acts like a lens.

Q: What is an Einstein Ring?
A: A specific form of gravitational lensing where the light from a distant source is distorted into a ring, which occurs when the source, lens, and observer are in perfect alignment.

Q: What are relativistic jets?
A: Powerful beams of ionized matter and radiation that are ejected from the poles of some accreting black holes at nearly the speed of light.

Q: How are relativistic jets powered?
A: They are thought to be powered by the intense magnetic fields in the accretion disk and the rotational energy of the black hole itself through the Blandford-Znajek process.

Q: What is the Penrose process?
A: A theoretical process where energy can be extracted from a rotating black hole's ergosphere, reducing the black hole's rotational energy and mass.

Q: How is general relativity related to black holes?
A: Black holes are a direct prediction of Einstein's theory of general relativity, which describes gravity as a curvature of spacetime caused by mass and energy.

Q: Does a black hole "suck" things in?
A: No, a black hole doesn't "suck." Its gravity works just like any other massive object's. You have to get very close to it to be captured by its intense gravitational pull.

Q: What is the information paradox?
A: A paradox that arises from combining quantum mechanics and general relativity, questioning what happens to the information of particles that fall into a black hole, as quantum mechanics says information can't be destroyed.

Q: How does Hawking radiation attempt to solve the information paradox?
A: It doesn't fully solve it. While it suggests black holes can evaporate, the radiation it predicts is thermal and seems to contain no information about what fell in, deepening the paradox.

Q: What is the ring singularity?
A: In a rotating (Kerr) black hole, the singularity is theorized to be a one-dimensional ring rather than a point.

Q: What is cosmic censorship hypothesis?
A: A conjecture which states that singularities are always hidden from an external observer behind an event horizon. A "naked singularity" would violate this.

Q: Can black holes have magnetic fields?
A: Black holes themselves cannot have their own magnetic field, but the plasma in their surrounding accretion disks can generate extremely powerful magnetic fields.

Q: How do we detect stellar-mass black holes?
A: Often by observing their effect on a companion star in a binary system. The black hole pulls material from the star, forming a hot, X-ray emitting accretion disk.

Q: What is an X-ray binary?
A: A binary star system that emits a large amount of X-rays, typically consisting of a normal star and a collapsed object like a black hole or neutron star.

Q: What was the first black hole to be directly imaged?
A: The supermassive black hole at the center of the Messier 87 (M87) galaxy, whose image was released by the EHT collaboration in 2019.

Q: What does the image of M87* actually show?
A: It shows the "shadow" of the black hole—the region where light is captured—silhouetted against the bright, glowing material of its accretion disk.

Q: How do we measure the mass of a black hole?
A: By observing the orbital speed and distance of a nearby star or gas cloud and applying Kepler's laws of motion.

Q: How do we measure the spin of a black hole?
A: It's more complex, but one method involves analyzing the shape of X-ray emissions from the inner edge of its accretion disk, which is affected by the black hole's spin.

Q: What are quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs)?
A: Flickering patterns in the X-ray light from accretion disks around black holes, which may hold clues about the strong gravity effects happening near the event horizon.

Q: Why do we use radio telescopes to image a black hole?
A: Radio waves can pass through the gas and dust that obscure the centers of galaxies, allowing us to see the region around the black hole that is invisible in other wavelengths.

Q: What is Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI)?
A: The technique used by the EHT, which combines signals from multiple telescopes to achieve the high angular resolution needed to see details as small as a black hole's shadow.

Q: What is Sagittarius A* (Sgr A*)?
A: The supermassive black hole at the center of our Milky Way galaxy.

Q: What is the mass of Sagittarius A*?
A: Approximately 4.3 million times the mass of the Sun.

Q: Has the Event Horizon Telescope imaged Sagittarius A*?
A: Yes, the EHT collaboration released the first image of the event horizon of Sagittarius A* in 2022.

Q: What is Cygnus X-1?
A: One of the first and most famous black hole candidates discovered. It is a stellar-mass black hole in a binary system in the constellation Cygnus.

Q: How was Cygnus X-1 confirmed to be a black hole?
A: By measuring the mass of the unseen companion object, which was found to be too massive to be a neutron star.

A: An ultramassive black hole, one of the most massive ever discovered, with a mass estimated at 66 billion solar masses. It powers an extremely bright quasar.

Q: What is the name of the black hole in the movie *Interstellar*?
A: Gargantua. While fictional, its depiction was based on theoretical equations and advised by physicist Kip Thorne.

Q: What is Hawking radiation?
A: A theoretical type of thermal radiation predicted to be spontaneously emitted by black holes due to quantum effects near the event horizon.

Q: How does Hawking radiation cause a black hole to lose mass?
A: It is produced by the creation of virtual particle-antiparticle pairs near the event horizon. When one particle falls in and the other escapes, the escaping particle carries away energy, which comes from the black hole's mass.

Q: Do all black holes evaporate at the same rate?
A: No, the rate of evaporation is inversely proportional to the black hole's mass. Smaller black holes radiate away their mass much faster than larger ones.

Q: How long would it take for a solar-mass black hole to evaporate?
A: An astronomically long time, far longer than the current age of the universe (about $10^{67}$ years).

Q: What is a wormhole?
A: A speculative structure, also known as an Einstein-Rosen bridge, that could connect two different points in spacetime, theoretically creating a shortcut through space and time.

Q: Are wormholes related to black holes?
A: The original mathematical concept of a wormhole arose from the solution for a Schwarzschild black hole. However, a traversable wormhole would require exotic matter with negative energy density to remain stable.

Q: What is a white hole?
A: A theoretical, time-reversed version of a black hole. While nothing can escape a black hole, nothing can enter a white hole. They are not believed to exist in nature.

Q: What is the firewall paradox?
A: A modern version of the information paradox that suggests an observer falling into an older black hole would be burned up by a "firewall" of high-energy quanta at the event horizon.

Q: What is the holographic principle?
A: A principle in quantum gravity theory which suggests that the information contained within a volume of space can be described by a theory on the boundary of that region, like a 3D image projected from a 2D surface.

Q: How does the holographic principle apply to black holes?
A: It suggests that all the information about the matter that fell into a black hole is encoded on its two-dimensional event horizon.

Q: Could a black hole be a doorway to another universe?
A: This is a popular idea in science fiction, but according to our current understanding of physics, the singularity would destroy anything that entered. Some speculative theories suggest otherwise, but there is no evidence.

Q: What is a naked singularity?

A: A hypothetical, tiny black hole, possibly formed in the early universe or potentially in high-energy particle collisions, that would evaporate almost instantly via Hawking radiation.

Q: Can black holes merge with neutron stars?
A: Yes, the merger of a black hole and a neutron star is a significant source of gravitational waves and is believed to produce heavy elements like gold and platinum.

Q: What is "frame-dragging"?
A: An effect of general relativity, also known as the Lense-Thirring effect, where a rotating massive object like a black hole twists the spacetime around it.

Q: What is the difference between a quasar and a blazar?
A: A blazar is a specific type of quasar where the relativistic jet is pointed almost directly at Earth, making it appear exceptionally bright.

Q: How fast can a black hole spin?
A: A black hole can spin at speeds approaching the speed of light at its equator, but it cannot reach it due to physical limits.

Q: What is a rogue or wandering black hole?
A: A black hole that is not gravitationally bound to a galaxy and travels through intergalactic space.

Q: How could a rogue black hole be formed?
A: It could be ejected from its host galaxy during a galactic merger or through gravitational interactions with other massive objects.

Q: Do black holes have a temperature?
A: Yes, according to Hawking's theory. The temperature is inversely proportional to its mass, so supermassive black holes are incredibly cold, colder than the cosmic microwave background.

Q: What is black hole thermodynamics?
A: A field of study that relates the laws of thermodynamics to black holes. For instance, a black hole's surface area (of its event horizon) behaves like entropy, as it can only increase.

A: Yes. In 2003, astronomers detected sound waves propagating through the gas in the Perseus galaxy cluster, generated by ripples from its central supermassive black hole.

Q: What is the accretion flow of Sagittarius A* like?
A: It is surprisingly faint and inefficient. Sgr A* consumes very little of the gas available to it, making it one of the weakest active galactic nuclei known.

Q: What is a "quiescent" black hole?
A: A black hole that is not actively accreting a significant amount of matter and therefore does not have a bright accretion disk.

Q: What is the spin-flip hypothesis?
A: A theory suggesting that if a supermassive black hole's spin axis is misaligned with its accretion disk, the resulting jets can flip direction, influencing the galaxy's evolution.

Q: Can we use gravitational lensing to find black holes?
A: Yes, the phenomenon of "microlensing," where a foreground object briefly magnifies a background star, can be used to detect isolated black holes that are otherwise invisible.

Q: What is the difference between the event horizon and the apparent horizon?
A: The event horizon is a global concept defined by future light paths, while the apparent horizon is a local boundary where outgoing light rays begin to move inward. For a stable black hole, they are the same.

Q: What is cosmic string theory's relation to black holes?
A: Some theories suggest that collapsing loops of hypothetical cosmic strings could form primordial black holes.

Q: What are "extremal" black holes?
A: A theoretical black hole with the maximum possible charge or spin for its mass. It would have a Hawking temperature of zero.

Q: Could a particle accelerator like the LHC create a micro black hole?
A: Some theories of extra dimensions suggest it might be possible, but no evidence has been found. If created, they would evaporate harmlessly and almost instantly via Hawking radiation.

Q: What is a "gravastar"?
A: A hypothetical alternative to a black hole, proposing that a collapsing star forms a shell of exotic matter rather than a singularity, with a vacuum-like interior.

Q: How is quantum entanglement related to Hawking radiation?
A: The virtual particle pairs that create Hawking radiation are entangled. When one falls into the black hole, the entanglement with the escaping particle becomes a central part of the information paradox.

Q: What is the gravitational memory effect?
A: A predicted permanent distortion in spacetime left behind after a powerful event like a black hole merger passes, which future detectors might be able to measure.

Q: Do black holes affect galaxy formation?
A: Yes, the powerful jets and radiation from a central supermassive black hole can heat or expel gas from a galaxy, regulating star formation in a process called "AGN feedback."

Q: What is the M-sigma relation?
A: An observed empirical correlation between the mass of a galaxy's central supermassive black hole (M) and the velocity dispersion (sigma) of stars in its bulge, suggesting a co-evolution.

Q: Could you survive crossing the event horizon of a supermassive black hole?
A: Theoretically, yes. For a supermassive black hole, the tidal forces at the event horizon are gentle enough that an object could cross without being immediately spaghettified. The doom would come later, at the singularity.

Q: What is a "holographic dual"?
A: In some string theories, a black hole in a higher-dimensional spacetime is mathematically equivalent (dual) to a system of interacting particles in a lower-dimensional space without gravity.

Q: What is a gamma-ray burst (GRB)?

Q: What is "black hole feedback"?
A: The process by which energy and momentum from an accreting black hole (via jets and radiation) influence the surrounding gas in its host galaxy.

Q: What is a "recoiling" black hole?
A: When two black holes merge, the resulting gravitational waves can be emitted asymmetrically, giving the final black hole a "kick" that can eject it from its galaxy's center.

Q: What is the Blandford-Znajek process?
A: A mechanism for extracting energy from a rotating black hole through electromagnetic fields, thought to be a leading explanation for powering relativistic jets.

Q: What is the maximum mass for a stellar-mass black hole?
A: There is a theoretical "mass gap" between about 50 and 150 solar masses where stars are thought to blow themselves apart completely in a "pair-instability supernova," leaving no remnant.

Q: How did LIGO "hear" the black hole merger?
A: LIGO doesn't hear sound. It detects the stretching and squeezing of spacetime. The gravitational wave signal was converted into a sound wave to create the famous "chirp."

Q: Can a black hole orbit another black hole?
A: Yes, binary black hole systems exist and are a primary source of detectable gravitational waves as they spiral toward each other and merge.

Q: How close is the nearest known black hole to Earth?
A: The closest known black hole is Gaia BH1, located about 1,560 light-years away.

Q: What is a "polarization" of gravitational waves?
A: Like light, gravitational waves have polarizations (plus and cross) that describe how they distort spacetime as they pass. Detecting these helps determine the source's properties.

Q: What is the "ringdown" phase of a black hole merger?
A: After two black holes merge, the newly formed black hole is distorted and settles into a stable state by vibrating and emitting gravitational waves, much like a struck bell rings down.

Q: Why was the image of Sgr A* harder to capture than M87*?
A: Because Sgr A* is much less massive, the gas in its accretion disk orbits much faster (in minutes versus days), causing its appearance to change rapidly during the observation.

Q: What is the "shadow" of a black hole?
A: The dark central region seen in EHT images, which is a combination of the event horizon and the gravitational lensing effect that bends light away from the observer's line of sight.

Q: What is a charged black hole?
A: A black hole with a net electric charge. They are considered unlikely to exist in nature, as they would quickly attract oppositely charged particles to neutralize themselves.

Q: What is the cosmic background radiation?
A: The faint glow of radiation left over from the Big Bang. Supermassive black holes are colder than this background, so they absorb more of it than they emit in Hawking radiation.

Q: If you fell into a black hole, what would you see?
A: Looking forward, you would see the singularity. Looking back, you would see the entire future history of the external universe flash before your eyes due to extreme time dilation.

Q: What is a "fuzzball" in string theory?
A: A theoretical alternative to the black hole singularity, where the object is a "ball" of fundamental strings, which has a volume and surface but no event horizon in the classical sense.

Q: Does the existence of black holes prove general relativity is correct?
A: The existence and observed properties of black holes (via gravitational waves and EHT images) provide some of the strongest evidence to date supporting Einstein's theory of general relativity.

Q: Can black holes be used for energy?
A: In theory, yes, via the Penrose process. A highly advanced civilization could potentially extract rotational energy from a Kerr black hole, but this is far beyond our current capabilities.

Q: What is a "kugelblitz"?
A: A theoretical black hole formed from a concentration of energy (light or radiation) rather than matter.

Q: What is the greatest mystery still surrounding black holes?
A: The nature of the singularity and the resolution of the information paradox, which requires a unified theory of quantum mechanics and gravity (quantum gravity).
